### What I learned

I took on this project to praticce the basics of positioning multiple elements on a webpage. 

Doing this project I've learned to use the name of elements instead of classes or ids. I also tried to work with elements and their hierarchy. Like the snippet below:

```
    section{}
    section h1{}
    section p{}
    footer{}
    footer a{}
```

As for the font size I used two measurements. The first was in **pixels** and the second one was is **rem**. That way the text will always look like I've imagined it.

In addittion I also learned to desing for different screen sizes. The challenge was to make the layout work on Small Screen Devices the same way it did on Desktop. 

### Useful resources
